# debut_age_viz

I have been a fan of K-pop music for more than five years. Nowadays, I came to realize how young the K-Pop idols debuted: the youngest idol who debuted in 2023 was only 14 years old. I was curious about whether idols from the 1990s also debuted this young or whether there was a lowering trend in debut ages.

To answer my questions, I manually collected information about 511 idols from 68 groups who debuted from 1996 to 2022. I then visualized and analyzed the data in R with the ggplot2 package. I found that the debut ages were roughly an inverted U shape from the 1990s to the present, and idols were debuting younger and younger from the 2010s until now. I also analyzed the trends by entertainment company and gender.

Then, I wrote an article in Mandarin to present my findings on WeChat in March, 2023 (link: <https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/v9ERa40Oa_RVTP7gid-IbQ>), a Chinese social media platform. I added notes and symbols to the visualizations to make them easier for a broad audience to understand. Moreover, I provided my initial thoughts on the reasons for the recent trend in idolsâ€™ debut ages and the related concerns.
